# Encryption Tool Setup with Vagrant

This is a quick explanation of how I set up the  encryption app using **Vagrant**, **NGINX**, **PHP-FPM**, and **VirtualBox**. After a system crash, the tool stopped working >>>>> and I was able to restore it by resolving compatibility issues and ensuring it runs smoothly in a modern development environment..

---

## The Problem
The tool relied on **PHP 7.1** and the deprecated `mcrypt` extension, which wasnâ€™t compatible with the default **PHP 8.3** installed in this restored Vagrant environment.  Things that must be done
1. Restore the development environment.
2. Ensure compatibility with the legacy code.
3. Make the tool accessible via `http://localhost:9191/`.

## How I went about solving  It

1. **I Downgraded PHP**:
   - i had to remove PHP 8.3 and then install PHP 7.1 to support the `mcrypt` extension.
   - Updated the provisioning script to automate PHP 7.1 installation for future setups.

2. **Configured NGINX**:
   - On `encryption.conf line 20` i updated the NGINX configuration to point to the correct PHP-FPM socket which is now `php7.1-fpm.sock`.
   - And on `encryption.conf line 4` I made sure the encryption-dev project was served from `/opt/c2/encryption-dev/public`.

3. **Fixed Synced Folders**:
   - Updated the `Vagrantfile` on line 45 to sync the`encryption-dev` folder to `/opt/c2/encryption-dev` in the VM.


4. **Tested Everything**:
   - Verified the application was accessible at `http://localhost:9191/`.
   - Tested the encryption functionality to make sure it worked as expected.

## Final results 
- Successfully restored a legacy PHP application in a modern development environment.
- Resolved compatibility issues by downgrading PHP and reconfiguring NGINX.
- Automated the setup process using Vagrant provisioning scripts for future use. ensuring that the right versions neeeded can be provisioned easily and at once
